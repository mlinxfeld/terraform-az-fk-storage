# terraform-az-fk-storage

This repository contains a reusable **Terraform / OpenTofu module** and progressive examples for deploying **Azure Storage** resources — from basic public access, through network hardening, to fully private access integrated with Virtual Machines.

It is part of the **FoggyKitchen.com training ecosystem** and is designed as a clean, composable **storage layer** that builds on top of an existing Azure networking foundation (VNet, subnets).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a **clear, educational, and architecture-aware reference implementation** for Azure Storage using Infrastructure as Code.

It focuses on:
- Azure Storage Accounts (StorageV2)
- Blob Containers and File Shares
- Network Rules and access boundaries
- Private Endpoints and Private DNS
- Real consumers (Virtual Machines) accessing storage privately

This is **not** a full landing zone or opinionated enterprise platform.
It is a **learning-first, building-block module**.

---

## ✨ What the module does

Depending on configuration and example used, the module can create:

- Azure Storage Account (StorageV2)
- Blob Containers
- File Shares
- Network Rules (IP / VNet allowlists)
- Private Endpoints (Blob, File)
- Integration with:
  - Azure Virtual Networks
  - Private DNS Zones
  - Virtual Machines

The module intentionally does **not** create:

- Virtual Networks or subnets
- Network Security Groups
- Bastion
- Load Balancers
- AKS clusters
- Monitoring or backup resources

Each of those concerns belongs in its own dedicated module.

## 🚀 Example Usage

module "storage" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/mlinxfeld/terraform-az-fk-storage.git?ref=v0.1.0"

  name                = "fksaexample"
  location            = "westeurope"
  resource_group_name = "fk-rg"

  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"

  create_containers = true
  containers = {
    artifacts = {}
    logs      = {}
  }

  tags = {
    project = "foggykitchen"
    env     = "dev"
  }
}

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- Storage access is a **networking problem first**
- Public endpoints and private access must be **explicit**
- DNS is part of the architecture, not an afterthought
- One example = one architectural concept
- Outputs are first-class citizens
- Modules are designed to be **composed**, not expanded endlessly
